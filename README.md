# About
Battleship Online is a real-time multiplayer web game built with TypeScript, React, Vite, Node.js, and WebSocket. The project follows a monorepo architecture using Turborepo and PNPM workspaces, ensuring efficient development and scalability.

Players can arrange their ships randomly or via drag-and-drop before starting a match. The game features matchmaking with random opponents or private rooms for friends. A real-time chat is available during gameplay.

## Key Features:
- Leaderboard updated daily in real-time
- Turn-based gameplay with a default 15-20 second timer (extendable upon request)
- Multiple maps and game modes for variety
- Minimal login system: Anonymous players can participate but won't gain ranking points
- WebSocket-powered real-time updates for game state and leaderboard
- The goal is to create the most engaging and competitive Battleship experience available online.
